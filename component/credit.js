            <p class="credit-text within-paragraph">
                Hello, my name is Georges Dahdouh, I made Front Seat app as a solo project in the 
                process of learning about restful APIs, and asynchronus Javascript. 
                As a user, you can search for your favorite movies, or check what's trending, what's playing now in theater's, and top rated movies, and save them to your watchlist.
            </p>
            <p class="credit-text within-paragraph">
                Your watchlist is saved in your browser, in the localstorage, Front Seat doesn't have a backend database. You can add, or remove titles to and from your watchlist, and you can click "read more" to find out more about the movie.
            </p>
            <p class="credit-text">this project is a part of the Front-End Career Path, module #9 in <a href="https://www.scrimba.com">Scrimba.com</a>, 
                instructed by Bob Ziroll.
